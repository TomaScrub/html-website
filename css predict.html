        Cogmantle plans its battles with machine-like
        precision, analysing terrain and opponents in
        moments. It disables foes with counters and
        calculated strikes, rarely wasting movement. Some
        Trainers report it rearranging their gear for
        “optimal efficiency”.

    <ul>
        <li>
            Battle Analyst - Opponents' dodge has no effect
            on likelihood to hit.
        </li>
        <li>
            Gear Strike - Attacks opponents with a spinning
            cog, which increases in power each round it
            doesn't hit.
